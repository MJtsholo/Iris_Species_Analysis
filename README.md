# Iris_Species_Analysis

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used in processes such as market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation and image compression. Usually we do K-Means clustering to:

 Understand the structure of the data, and group similar observations.
 Cluster the data into subgroups and then do different predictions on the different subgroups. If we think that subgroup     behaviours differ substantially, then we will get more accurate models by making separate models for each subgroup, than one model for all groups.

## Easy clustering assignment: Flower features
### Data: Iris species

1. Use K-Means cluster analysis to cluster different iris species. Make an elbow plot and/or use silhouette analysis to find the optimal number of clusters.

2. What are the factors that differ between different iris species?

3. Create a plot of the clusters.
